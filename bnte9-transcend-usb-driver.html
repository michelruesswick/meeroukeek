I was away from home for the past 6 months, and came home to the new BIOS update (1.8.1), but have been having small issues since then that I can't fix for the life of me. Issue 1: The touchpad does not work. The laptop does not even register that there is a driver nor a touchpad. Mouse settings shows the USB mouse as the only available pointer hardware. Device Manager shows only the USB mouse as well. I would try updating the driver, but there doesn't appear to be any driver to updat.

I just picked up a Lenovo Explorer from the Microsoft store, got everything hooked up, and right away I notice the headset display randomly goes black. This happens maybe every 30 seconds, and the display stays black for 2-5 seconds. The headset continues to track movement and I can see everything on my monitor. The headset HDMI is plugged directly into my GPUs HDMI port, and the USB is connected to a 3.0 port. My WMR drivers are all up to date.

Since it'll most likely be asked, I was order #244, in the US, and I received my Win 2 on May 23rd. ampnbsp;I only had 2 days to set up before leaving for a 9 day vacation which would include 20 hours of being a passenger in a car. I researched ahead of time and purchased some accessories, a cheap SSD that no one else has tested in the Win 2 yet (to my knowledge), and found my perfect carry case for the Win 2.

So I received a used 1TB Transcend External Hard Drive (Model: TS1TSJ25A3K) and tried plugging it into my PC but when I opened Windows Explorer it was not there. So I checked the Device Manager and Disk Management and it does show up as StoreJet Transcend and says 'device is working properly' and that a driver is installed when clicking on properties. In disk management the drive showed up as Disk 1 Partition 3 (?) with a capacity of around 961GB as health but without a file system.

BIOS: There are really huge performance boost when you boost power your CPU up to 12W, but without cooling mod your WIN2 will be as hot as WIN1(not good) and battery life will be significant decrease(not important for me, but look at your usage case).

So it's been proven that you can upgrade the default drive from 128gb to the 256gb. I would probably grab the 512gb transcend one for my win 2 if I get one. Question is, how would you reinstall everything on the new drive? If I recall, windows 10 doesn't use a traditional cdkey anymore and attaches to the motherboard or some hardware instead. I'm going to assume you first make sure windows is activated on the 128gb drive and then install it via usb method on the new drive. Which brings

I don't need the latest and greatest tech, just something that'll give me a little more juice. It's mainly used for gaming and I currently have no problems running most current games around medium.
